<h2>The Roundtable Lottery</h2><div id="problem_icons" class="noprint"><span class="tooltip">‚ÑπÔ∏è<span class="tooltiptext_right">Published on Saturday, 9th November 2013, 07:00 pm; Solved by 334;<br>Difficulty rating: 60%</span></span></div><div id="problem_info"><h3><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=444">Problem 444</a></h3></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>A group of $p$ people decide to sit down at a round table and play a lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from ¬£1 to ¬£$p$, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for all of the players to maximize the winnings of the ticket they hold upon leaving the game.</p>

<p>An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>The player can choose to scratch the ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.</li>
<li>If the player's ticket is unscratched, then the player may trade it with a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leaves the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches the newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.</li>
</ol>

<p>The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.</p>

<p>Assume that players will use the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of their ticket winnings.</p>

<p>Let $E(p)$ represent the expected number of players left at the table when the game ends in a game consisting of $p$ players.<br>
E.g. $E(111) = 5.2912$ when rounded to 5 significant digits.</p>

<p>Let $S_1(N) = \sum \limits_{p = 1}^{N} {E(p)}$.<br>
Let $S_k(N) = \sum \limits_{p = 1}^{N} {S_{k-1}(p)}$ for $k \gt 1$.</p>

<p>Find $S_{20}(10^{14})$ and write the answer in scientific notation rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent. For example, the answer for $S_3(100)$ would be 5.983679014e5.</p>
