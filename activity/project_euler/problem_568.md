<h2>Reciprocal Games II</h2><div id="problem_icons" class="noprint"><span class="tooltip">‚ÑπÔ∏è<span class="tooltiptext_right">Published on Saturday, 3rd September 2016, 04:00 pm; Solved by 318;<br>Difficulty rating: 55%</span></span></div><div id="problem_info"><h3><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=568">Problem 568</a></h3></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>Tom has built a random generator that is connected to a row of $n$ light bulbs. Whenever the random generator is activated each of the $n$ lights is turned on with the probability of $\frac 1 2$, independently of its former state or the state of the other light bulbs.</p>

<p>While discussing with his friend Jerry how to use his generator, they invent two different games, they call the <dfn>reciprocal games</dfn>:<br>
Both games consist of $n$ turns. Each turn is started by choosing a number $k$ randomly between (and including) $1$ and $n$, with equal probability of $\frac 1 n$ for each number, while the possible win for that turn is the reciprocal of $k$, that is $\frac 1 k$.</p>

<p>In game A, Tom activates his random generator once in each turn. If the number of lights turned on is the same as the previously chosen number $k$, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing for that turn. Jerry's expected win after playing the total game A consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_A(n)$. For example $J_A(6)=0.39505208$, rounded to $8$ decimal places.</p>

<p>For each turn in game B, after $k$ has been randomly selected, Tom keeps reactivating his random generator until exactly $k$ lights are turned on. After that Jerry takes over and reactivates the random generator until he, too, has generated a pattern with exactly $k$ lights turned on. If this pattern is identical to Tom's last pattern, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing. Jerry's expected win after the total game B consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_B(n)$. For example $J_B(6)=0.43333333$, rounded to $8$ decimal places.</p>

<p>Let $D(n)=J_B(n)‚àíJ_A(n)$. For example, $D(6) = 0.03828125$.</p>

<p>Find the $7$ most significant digits of $D(123456789)$ after removing all leading zeros.<br>
(If, for example, we had asked for the $7$ most significant digits of $D(6)$, the answer would have been 3828125.)</p>
