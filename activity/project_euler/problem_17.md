## (P17) Number Letter Counts


If the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are $3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$ letters used in total.
If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? 
<p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, $342$ (three hundred and forty-two) contains $23$ letters and $115$ (one hundred and fifteen) contains $20$ letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
